//LESSON 1
//Output statements
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String name = "Fred";
        System.out.println(name);
        //always have to have a main class before you write java, otherwise won't work, do this by writing the key word as main or psvm and press enter. If you have multiple Java's linked together at least one needs to have this.
        //Main method runs the program. If you don't it won't be able to run
        //System.out.println("Hello World!");
        //System.out.println("This is line 2");
        //unlike python, you need a semicolon at the end of statements
        //println prints your text line by line
        //just print will print on one line
        //always use comments in every part of your code to explain to yourself - like a sticky note
    }
}

//LESSON 2
//Variables and data types
//Variables is an empty box, in java need to state what the variable type is when you create the variable
//data-types identifier = data;
//identifier - name we give the variable
//int number = 9; or
// String myName = "Chris"; - string must be caps S
//float uses half as much space as a double, floats carry half as many characters than a double
//float - decimal point, double- decimal number, String - text, int - integer
//float circleRadius = 12.4f; need the f but if you are using na equation don't need to use the f
//WHEN DECLARED AS ONE VARIABLE, CANNOT BE CHANGED LATER, however an integer can be assigned to a decimal Number because integers are also decimal numbers 4.2 = 1.0
//cannot have two variables with the same name

//String variable example - uncomment when needed
//public class Main {
    //public static void main(String[] args) {
        //String name = "Fred";
        //System.out.println(name);
